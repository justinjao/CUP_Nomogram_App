# Cancers of Unknown Primary Nomogram Application
A nomogram app for Cancers of Unknown Primary (CUP). The link to the app can be found [here](https://cupnomogram.shinyapps.io/Nomogram/).

This is a shiny application demonstrating the usage of a nomogram for Cancers of Unknown Primary, for potential use in oncology clinics.

## The CUP Problem

It is a well known problem within oncology that prognostication for cancers of unknown primary is significantly more uncertain, and assessments on survival rates can vary widely between different physicians.

To simplify this problem, we have devised a nomogram to display estimated One Year & Two Year Overall Survival (OS) rates, using 5 well known and validated prognostic factors: Sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Status, Histology, Number of Metastatic Sites, and the Neutrophil-Lymphocite Ratio (NLR). The nomogram was devised by a team of clinicians and scientists across BC Cancer, MD Anderson, and Sarah Cannon. To allow ease of real time use of the nomogram in clinical settings, we designed a simple web and mobile friendly application. The implementation and code used to design the app is provided here.

## About the App:

The app was designed and deployed using the R Shiny package.

The sidebar details the 5 prognostic factors that can be modified.

The 2 gauges displayed in the center change reactively to user input, automatically calculating survival rates.
